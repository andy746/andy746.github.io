                The answer to this is simple, we can have all the  
                above things only if we have performance. So  
                performance is like currency through which we can 
                buy all the above things. Another reason  
                for studying performance is – speed is fun!

                For example, let us say, we want to store marks of  
                all students in a class, we can use an array to store 
                them. This helps in reducing the use of number of  
                variables as we don’t need to create a separate  
                variable for marks of every subject.  All marks can 
                be accessed by simply traversing the array.

                Asymptotic Analysis is the big idea that handles  
                above issues in analyzing algorithms. In Asymptotic 
                Analysis, we evaluate the performance of an algorithm 
                in terms of input size (we don’t measure the actual  
                running time). We calculate, how does the time  
                (or space) taken by an algorithm increases with  
                the input size. 
            </p>

            <p> 
                Also, in Asymptotic analysis, we always talk about  
                input sizes larger than a constant value. It might  
                be possible that those large inputs are never given 
                to your software and an algorithm  which is  
                asymptotically slower, always performs better for  
                your particular situation. So, you may end up choosing 
                an algorithm that is Asymptotically slower but faster  
                for your software.
